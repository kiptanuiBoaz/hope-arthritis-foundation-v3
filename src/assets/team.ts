        name: "Ms Charlene Hopper",
        title: "Paediatric Rheumatology Nurse, McGill University",
        image: "charlene.webp",
        bio: `Charlene Hopper is a nurse clinician in the Rheumatology Division of the Montreal Children's Hospital (MCH) in Quebec, Canada. Her nursing experience spans 35 years, practicing in various settings, the last 20 in pediatric rheumatology. She studied in Canada and holds a Bachelor of Nursing from the University of New Brunswick and a Master of Science in Nursing from McGill University.

As a nurse clinician on a multidisciplinary team, Charlene works closely with families whose child has a rheumatologic condition. Her role is to provide support, education and guidance to the child and their family as they learn to navigate a chronic condition and its treatments. She is a strong advocate for children and ensures that their needs are understood, for example, in the school setting. For her outstanding contributions to pediatric rheumatology, Charlene received the “Nursing Award of Excellence” from the MCH Foundation in 2017.

Charlene has an ongoing commitment to education and knowledge transfer. She is involved in mentoring and educational activities for the multidisciplinary pediatric rheumatology team at the MCH, presenting on areas of her nursing expertise. She has become the point person for guiding the team’s practice on vaccination in pediatric rheumatology and stays up-to-date on this topic.

Charlene's research interests include methotrexate intolerance from the child's perspective. She mentored and supervised two Master of Science in Nursing students who conducted a qualitative study to explore this topic. The results of the study were presented at PRYSM in 2017 and published in the Journal of Pediatric Nursing (Perceptions of methotrexate intolerance and its impact on daily life in school-age children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 48 (2019) 49-54). The study provides important insights into the child's experience with methotrexate.

After training in hypnosis, Charlene introduced hypnosis as an innovative approach to helping children through the stress and anxiety of a joint injection as an alternate to sedation. The children and staff appreciate the sense of calm that is created during the procedure and the advantage that children can be discharged home immediately following the procedure without the need to recover from sedation.

Sleep-away camp is a typical childhood experience for many children in Canada, but not all children with rheumatic diseases are able to attend regular camp. To make the summer camp experience available to children with rheumatic diseases, Charlene volunteers her time to help organize and attend Camp Articulaction, an adapted rheumatology camp. Her involvement with the camp ensures that children with rheumatic diseases experience camp while accommodating their rheumatic conditions.

Transition of care from the pediatric to adult rheumatology setting is another interest of Charlene’s. She coordinates the transition of care program in collaboration with an adult rheumatologist. This program ensures a smooth transition of care for these young adult patients.

Charlene’s interaction and engagement with families is at the core of her role as a nurse. She finds tremendous satisfaction in seeing young people and their caregivers gain expertise and confidence in their care`
